This is the backend for my React Blaster game. 
To run the backend, be sure to have up to date versions of Ruby and Rails installed.

Play the game: https://react-blaster.herokuapp.com/

All styling and animation was done in CSS, featuring Hover.CSS by Ian Lunn (https://ianlunn.github.io/Hover/) for most buttons in the game.

All art assets were drawn by me, using GIMP.

All music was custom made. 

Playing the game:
React Blaster features in-game instructions, as well as example GIFS for every level. The general structure of the game is simple. Each level features a grid of targets that shuffle every two seconds, for 30 seconds. The grid includes targets you want to click on to destroy, and targets you want to avoid. 
Destroying the correct targets earns you points, which can be spent in the shop for health and weapon upgrades. Destroying the wrong targets can cost you points, health, or cause you to lose the level. 
To beat any level, you must finish the level with a certain number points (your goal is given before each level), and without destroying too many of the wrong targets or running out of health.
The game currently features three levels and a boss fight, and can be played using a mouse or just the trackpad.

Updates:
I have many updates planned for this game, which will be listed at https://github.com/CastagnaTM/react_blaster as they are added in.
